ghost-tree
==========

|Build Status| |Coverage Status|

ghost-tree is a bioinformatics tool that combines sequence data from two
genetic marker databases into one phylogenetic tree that can be used for
diversity analyses. One database is used as a backbone or scaffold because it
provides better phylogeny across all phyla, and the other database provides
finer taxonomic resolution.

This project is currently under active development. If you're interested in

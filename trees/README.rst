ghost-tree: trees repository
============================


Here is the ghost-tree repository of pre-constructed trees for **fungi** when you
sequenced using the **ITS** region (including ITS-1 or ITS-2). Most users can find
their tree here and not have to install ghost-tree.  You can use these trees
for downstream diversity analyses (e.g., to make phylogenetic PCoA plots).

Currently the SILVA 119 nr SSU database has been used to make ALL ghost-tree
foundation trees.

02/19/15: I have uploaded trees made with the current ghost-tree code. They are
made with various releases of the UNITE DB (QIIME release) for either 80 or 100
percent similarity clusters.

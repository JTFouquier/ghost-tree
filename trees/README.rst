Trees Repository


Here is the ghost-tree repository of pre-constructed trees for fungi when you
sequenced using ITS sequences (including ITS-1 or ITS-2). Most users can find
their tree here and not have to install ghost-tree.  You can use these trees
for downstream diversity analyses (e.g., to make phylogenetic PCoA plots).

Naming convention:

“ghosttree” + Extension tree information + SUMACLUST % similarity threshold
+ date made + .nwk

Currently the SILVA 119 nr SSU database has been used to make ALL ghost-tree
foundation trees.

05/27/15: A batch of reference trees were added. If you need one not found
here, please send me a message and I will do my best to help you out.

Research for transitioning from QIIME to SciKit-Bio:

Prune trees (at end of code):

Shear trees (probably > pruneâ€¦ keep only names in a list)****  
http://scikit-bio.org/docs/0.2.0/generated/skbio.tree.TreeNode.shear.html#skbio.tree.TreeNode.shear

Neighbor joining phylogenetic reconstruction

	need distance matrix dm
	function needed: result_constructor to return a Newick file

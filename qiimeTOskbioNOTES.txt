Research for transitioning from QIIME to SciKit-Bio:

Prune trees (at end of code):
http://scikit-bio.org/docs/0.2.0/generated/skbio.tree.TreeNode.prune.html#skbio.tree.TreeNode.prune

Shear trees (probably > prune… keep only names in a list)****  
http://scikit-bio.org/docs/0.2.0/generated/skbio.tree.TreeNode.shear.html#skbio.tree.TreeNode.shear

Neighbor joining phylogenetic reconstruction (make phylogeny for 18S and FastTree for ITS)
http://scikit-bio.org/docs/0.2.0/generated/skbio.tree.nj.html#skbio.tree.nj
	need distance matrix dm
	function needed: result_constructor to return a Newick file

Fix .fasta file:
in qiime fix_arb_fasta.py helps to clean up the Silva file
?  code in skbio… uknown

Alignment (currently MUSCLE.Switch to skbio alignment?)
